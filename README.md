Hash Map

This project involves creating a custom HashMap in JavaScript to demonstrate understanding and application of hash tables. This HashMap will handle key-value storage with efficient retrieval and supports string keys only. This implementation will cover hash function design, collision resolution, dynamic resizing, and standard operations like insertion, deletion, and lookup.
